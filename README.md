# CodeTrybe Projects
**CodeTrybe** is a community of **software engineers** in the **ALX SE** program, brought together by [**Topman Paul-Dike**](https://github.com/tpauldike) from different cohorts for the very purpose of learning together and helping one another to understand certain concepts as we acquire the desired skills.

Heavily suppported by a few young men and women of like mind, Topman led the **Main Team** to the point where its members started practicing outside of ALX SE projects to get better and acquire more experience, carrying everyone along.

This repository holds all the projects we came up with, from the simple ones to the complex ones and to the point where we had to _solve real problems_
